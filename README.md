# playlab
collective interactive platform for participatory design

In order for public engagement to be more meaningful to urban designers, participatory methods using agent-based simulations can allow stakeholders to intuitively play within design constraints. playLab.City provides a platform, situated between urban design participation and agent based simulation, where stakeholders have a greater opportunity to exercise their right to the city.
